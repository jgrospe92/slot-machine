- A CLI slot machine game built using javascript

# Features
- Deposit Balance:
  - Before playing, the application asks the user to enter a deposit amount. The application checks if the entered amount is valid or not
- Determine the Number of Lines to Bet On:
  - The user needs to enter the number of lines they want to bet on. The more lines they bet on, the higher their chances of winning. However, more lines mean it is more expensive to play the game.
- Collect the Bet Amount:
  - The total bet is multiplied by the number of lines. Then it is deducted from the player's balance.
- Spin the Machine:
  - After the user has selected the number of lines and the bet amount, they can spin the slot machine.
- Check if the User Won:
  - The game verifies if there's a line that has the matching symbol. This determines if the player has won the game.
- Give the User Their Winnings:
  - If the player wins, it will automatically be added to their balance.
- Play Again:
  - After each round, the player has a choice to continue or stop playing the game. Additionally, before the game starts, the application checks if the player has insufficient funds remaining. Otherwise, the player can no longer play the game.
